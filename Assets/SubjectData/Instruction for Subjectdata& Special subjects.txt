Use this to create 'special characters' that significantly affect the story (or a fun easter egg character if you want)

This will create a fixed preset of subject that won't be affected by random generation.

Right click on project tab(right here in this folder) -> Create -> TheAImitationGame -> SubjectData
Select the created subjectdata and name it properly, then adjust the parameters in the inspector.
